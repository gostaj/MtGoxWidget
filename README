An Android widget for displaying the current value of a Bitcoin in US dollars on the
Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange. A 24h graph is shown if you tap the widget.

The widget will be updated every 30th minute (which currently isn't configurable).
Value will be green if the value has increased (compared to the previous value),
red if it has decreased, or yellow if the value hasn't changed.

I'm happy to receive feedback, bug reports and Bitcoins:
